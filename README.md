TLDR
To get started, make sure you have expo installed.
Inside the `frontend` folder, run `npm install`.
Then either run `expo start` and either:
1. open the application through the medium of choice, such as the iOS simulator on computer, or;
2. scan the QR code to open in Expo on your phone or tablet.
